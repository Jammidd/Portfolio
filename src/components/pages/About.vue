        <p>
            I am Richard Middleton, a full-stack developer with an emphasis in back-end development with Python.
            I enjoy creating automation tools, APIs, and experimenting with technologies such as Machine Learning,
            Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, and more. I am fascinated by robotics and the potential
            that comes with advances in that field. 
        </p>

	        I am learning Spanish, currently I understand much but struggle to speak it. I enjoy water sports such
            as kayaking, boating, and jet-skiing when I can, and when I canâ€™t I stick to games such as D&amp;D or
            video games, specifically open world style games like Skyrim.
